## Mission

Our mission is to open Web3 opportunities by providing blockchain benefits and usefullness a step closer to the ordinary people and to help accelerate the advancement and strengthening the industry as a whole.

## Acknowledgement

Selendra project is inspired by the excellent work of many growing projects in the Polkadot ecosystem and many other blockchain developers around the world. Our progress in the past, the present and the future is only possible thanks to the open sources software community, framework, and tools. Thank you!

This is a work in progress, we will update more information as we progress further. Please refer to the token economy working paper for more details.

# Branches Strategy

Inspired by `Brave Branch Strategy` 
```
prod => releases to production
master || main => releases to staging
dev => releases to development
```

Below is how we work with Branches.

```mermaid
    gitGraph
      commit
      commit
      branch dev
      checkout dev
      commit
      branch members
      checkout members
      commit
      commit
      commit
      checkout dev
      merge members
      commit
      checkout main
      merge dev
      commit
      commit
      branch prod
      checkout prod
      commit
      commit id: "Release" tag: "v1.0.0"
```

1. production releases should only be made after have been able to test exactly what we're going to release on stage. So these should always be a PR from `master` to `prod` that's basically `"make production === stage"`. These are the only PRs that should go to `prod`.

2. therefore a merge to `master` should only happen when we think the feature is ready to release.

3. when starting a piece of work, create a branch off `master` and keep adding commits there until it's ready to release.

4. to test the code in a real environment, either: 
- a. merge that branch to dev - but don't delete the feature branch. Repeatedly merge the feature that feature branch to dev as work progresses. Merges to dev do not require PRs. OR 
- b. manually initiate the `"Deploy to Development"` github action selecting that branch - this will deploy just those changes to development.

5. In-development QA of this feature should happen on the development environment.

6. when it's good to go merge the feature branch to `master` - with a PR and security review if required. 

7. Do not merge until all reviews are completed.
then, after checking on the staging environment (including QA regression testing if needed) PR a production release as per step 1.

8. now and again we will reset dev to match `master` just to keep the history tidy.
